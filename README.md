# Data Journalism and D3

![7-animated-scatter](images/7-animated-scatter.gif)

#### Why make a static graphic when D3 lets you interact with your data?
 
This Data Driven Document(D3) project demonstrates building an interactive data visualization showing state-level data about three health risk factors (obesity, smoking and lack of healthcare) plotted against three perhaps underlying factors (income, poverty rate and age) based on 2014 U.S. Census data. The Chart was build using D3.js. Each marker represents an individual state in The USA.

* Note: You'll need to use `serve` or `python -m http.server` to run the visualization.

### Technologies used: 

` D3.js | SVG | JavaScript | HTML | CSS `

          <p><b><center>In this  Data-Driven Document (D3), the Interactive data visualization shows some state-level data about three health risk factors (obesity, smoking and lack of healthcare) plotted against three perhaps underlying factors (income, poverty rate and age) based on 2014 U.S. Census data.<br>
          The Chart was build using D3.js. Each marker represents an individual state in The USA. Click on any of the axis titles to start exploring!</center></b></p>

          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks Vs Poverty, Age and Income</h2>

          <p>Health Risks and Poverty: Clearly, TX with a poverty rate of approx. 17.5% shows the highest percent of demographic that lack healthcare (25%). 
            Also states with lower poverty percentage have significantly lower obesity rate. 
            Smoking is prevalent in states with high poverty rate like WV, KY and MS.</p>

          <p>Health Risks and Age: The chart clearly shows that people who lack healthcare fall between 36 to 40 years of age group. Also, Smoking rate is higher among adults between 36-42 years old. Adults in the age group 34-36 in TX also tend to lack Healthcare. </p>

          <p>Health Risks and Income: We can also conclude that overall healthcare improves with increase in median income. In general the states with median income above $65,000 have lack healthcare. Also, Lower income was consistently associated with higher smoking prevalence. States like WV, KY, AR and MS with lower median income have significantly higher smoking percentage. </p>
